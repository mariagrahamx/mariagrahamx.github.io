    <h4>
      Deindustrialisation in Scotland accelerated during the second half of the twentieth century,
      marked by the collapse of key industries such as coal mining, shipbuilding, steel, and heavy engineering.
      This decline left a substantial legacy of neglected land across the nation that coincided with significant
      economic and social shifts, particularly within the Central Belt, which was once a highly industrialised region
      of the country.
      <br><br>
      Focusing on Glasgow City, this project uses publicly available geospatial and socioeconomic data to examine the incidence of derelict
      and vacant land sites within the Local Authority and to explore the relationship they have with deprivation.

    deprived deciles (deciles 1 to 3).

    Is Deprivation Spatially Associated with Distance to Derelict and Vacant Land in Glasgow?
  </h1>

  <p>Across the four of the five observed SIMD domains, higher levels of deprivation are seen in data zones located closest 
    to derelict and vacant land sites, as shown by the clustering in the bottom-left of each plot. 
    A weak but consistent positive gradient between distance and SIMD rank across those domains suggests that 
    proximity to derelict or vacant land is associated with deprivation in Glasgow.

    Does Regeneration of Derelict and Vacant Land Affect Nearby Area Deprivation Over Time?
  </h1>

  <p> Between 2012 and 2014, a previously neglected industrial brownfield site in Glasgow was repurposed through a 
    regeneration project to form the Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Following the Games, 
    the site was further developed into permanent housing and green spaces for public use. Using SIMD data from
    approximately two and six years after the site became publicly accessible, the chart below examines changes in median
    deprivation levels across data zones at varying distances from the site.

    repurposed derelict site by subtracting 2016 median SIMD ranks from those in 2020. It shows that changes in deprivation

    Conclusions
  </h1>

  <p> Glasgow is one of Scotland’s most deprived cities, with a high concentration of derelict and vacant land rooted in its 
    industrial history. While deprivation and the presence of such sites frequently coincide, proximity alone does not fully 
    explain Glasgow’s high deprivation levels, as reflected in the weak predictive power of the supervised learning model 
    (R² = 20.2%).

<br><br>
Analysis of the Athletes’ Village regeneration project shows no clear short-term trend in the deprivation outcomes of surrounding areas, 
though it must be noted that socioeconomic change often unfolds over longer time horizons than those observed here. Overall, 
the findings point to a complex relationship between land use and deprivation, suggesting that effective policy responses 
require more nuanced, context-specific interventions beyond regeneration alone.
